# Introduction to Self Driving Car
---

This repository contains a series of tutorials for the self driving car. It is mainly adapted from Udemy course: [The Complete Self-Driving Car Course - Applied Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/). All the deep learning methods are implemented using keras library.
